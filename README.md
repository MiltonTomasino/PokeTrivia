# PokeTrivia
## IOS app dedicated to Pokemon Trivia games
### This app is used for killing time and also providing as a database for basic information on some Pokemon anyone can access from an app on their phone.

## Retrieving Data 
### Website Data
- I scraped https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all ~~and uploaded the data to Firebase.~~
- Data is now locally stored in a JSON file so sensitive database info isn't stored in this repo
### Scraping Website
